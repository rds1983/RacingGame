## XNA-4-Racing-Game-Kit
=====================

The XNA-4-Racing-Game-Kit project aims to bring the original RacingGame (http://exdream.com/XnaRacingGame/) up to date, from it's design on an older XNA Framework to the most recent MonoGame and FNA frameworks. Once that is complete, bugs will be fixed and minor additions will be made.

## Building From Source Code for FNA

Clone following repos in one folder:
* [FNA](https://github.com/FNA-XNA/FNA)
* [DdsKtxXna](https://github.com/rds1983/DdsKtxXna)
* [FontStashSharp](https://github.com/FontStashSharp/FontStashSharp)
* [XNAssets](https://github.com/rds1983/XNAssets)
* This repo

Then simply open RacingGame.FNA.Core.sln in the IDE and run.
